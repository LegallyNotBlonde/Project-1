## Project Summary: AI Companies vs. S&P 500 and Dow Jones

This project examined the performance of top AI companies in comparison to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indices over the last five years (2019-2024). We analyzed daily and cumulative returns, as well as volatility (risk), to evaluate profitability and risk associated with each investment option.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses
### Question
Does the growth of AI stocks over the last 5 years indicate a more profitable and safer investment compared to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indices?

### Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the returns of AI stocks and market indices from 2019 to 2024. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): AI stocks show a significant difference in returns compared to the market indices during the same period.

### Background and Key Metrics
We focused on average stock prices, daily and cumulative returns, and volatility (standard deviation (STD)) to analyze stock performance. We categorized risk based on volatility as follows:

* Low Risk: Volatility less than 10%
* Medium Risk: Volatility between 10% and 20%
* High Risk: Volatility greater than 20%

## Statistical Analysis and Findings
### Plots
* Bar and Line Graphs: Displayed the average cumulative and daily returns for AI companies and indices.
* Volatility Analysis: Showed daily returns with error bars indicating volatility.
* Violin Plots: Illustrated the distribution of returns to support ANOVA results.

## Statistical Testing
* Repeated Measures ANOVA: Found no significant differences between AI companies and indices, failing to reject the null hypothesis.
* Post-hoc Pairwise T-tests: Identified significant differences between individual companies (e.g., Nvidia vs. Amazon).
## Conclusions
The analysis indicates that AI companies, while having periods of high returns, do not consistently outperform or exhibit lower risk than the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indices. The overall market performance of AI stocks does not significantly differ from these indices, leading to the conclusion that investments in these AI companies are comparable in risk and profitability to traditional market index investments.

## Additional Observations
Average Closing Prices: AI stock prices fluctuated more than those of the indices, suggesting higher volatility and potentially higher risk for conservative investors.
This comprehensive study underscores that while specific AI companies may occasionally outperform, as a group they align closely with broader market behaviors.
Notably, eight of the ten AI companies analyzed are listed in the S&P 500, with the exception of those represented by the tickers "PATH" and "AI."
